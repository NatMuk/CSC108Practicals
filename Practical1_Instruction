You are my CSC108 TAs, and let me introduce you to Stewart Smith, the head
TA for the course! But more introductions later! We have work to do!

The email below is for the benefit of those few that did not recieve it
earlier. Please check your schedule and let me know if there are any
issues.

Briefly: Tutorial assignments are at

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Oijhb7q1V0COiIPBMdQM6cAFEe5LawwQjlW53Q3-_QY/edit?usp=sharing

Note that I need two additional sections covered TH 11-12. Please let me
know if you are interested.

Whats up for this week? I am taking a bit of a risk this year, working
with VMs for the course. Students can work directly on the lab systems, or
work via the VM in the labs, as well as on their laptops. Students will
need to install VMware on their systems.

Now the other interesting problem: They will use GIT to interact with the
instructor. Hows that for a challenge in first year! The first tutorial
(next week, yes the first week) will be an install fest as well, as a run
through on how to use the VM. Here are some notes I have about the VM...

VMWare can be downloaded from

https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/downloads

I believe I had to ask Andrew to get the license for VMFusion, on the MAC.

The virtual machine
- Turtle, pillow and pycharm (with git integration) installed
- Git integration may not work on the VM, I had to
         sudo apt-get install git
   if pycharms git integration is not working.
- csc108 accounts password is csc108student (the user is actually student)
- (grab a console, terminal on mac, or cygwin) and then
    scp UTORID@dh2020pc01.utm.utoronto.ca:/virtual/csc108/csc108vm.vmwarevm.zip .
- Let me know if the above does not work, I will move the vm into the
   website

First Tutorial:-----------------------------------------------------------
Here is what I am thinking...possibly the order is not right, I have no
idea how smoothly the install and download will go, and it won't apply to
everyone. I should put the VM on the website to simplify the download.
My main concern with all of this, is that students may abandon the lab for
working after this.

First Hour:
0) No long explanations, just get them to follow along! This is about
    the mechanics of using the tools, like the first time on a bike.
    You are told where to sit, what you hold, where you put your feet.
    Then parents push you around, so you can go through the motions.

    Get students with experience helping those without.

1) Start the VM on the desktops (this has to work for Windows as well as
    Linux, we are using both labs)
2) Have students write hello world and run it
3) Write hello turtle:

import turtle
t = turtle.Turtle()
t.forward(100)
t.right(90)
t.forward(100)

4) Ask them to draw a square

Next hour:
1) Install VMWare
2) Grab the VM
3) Get them to start the VM on their laptops.
4) Get them to write and run hello turtle.
5) Show them how to shudown their VM.
